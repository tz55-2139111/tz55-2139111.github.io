        Informatics is the study, design, and development of information technology for the good of people, organizations, and society. As an Informatics student at the UW iSchool, you'll explore the intersection of technology and human values, gaining a deep understanding information in society while creatively imagining more equitable and just information technology and systems. Informatics graduates see the world as more than just innovative apps and websites, but as larger systems of people, information and technology that harness these technologies to address global challenges in democracy, health, wellness, climate, justice and more.

    <h2>Core courses</h2>
        <p1>Our core required courses, all at the 300-level, span the six areas of the curriculum: data, development, design, discovery, ethics and organizations. Each course provides a foundation that students use in their Capstone projects. Students deepen their expertise in a broad range of electives taught by iSchool faculty and invited guest faculty from industry, government and nonprofits around the Puget Sound area.

            In addition to the core INFO courses, the degree also requires two foundational courses in computer science, to provide the foundations necessary for succeeding in technical Informatics courses and technical interviews:
            <br>
            CSE 143: Computer Programming II OR CSE 163: Intermediate Data Programming
            <br>
            Choose one of these three options:
            <br>
            CSE 373: Data Structures and Algorithms (4 credits)
            <br>
            INFO 442: Cooperative Software Development (5 credits), not offered every quarter
            <br>
            INFO 443: Software Architecture (5 credits), not offered every quarter
            <br>
            Building upon these foundations, students then take a range of Informatics electives, culminating in either a Capstone project for students interested in careers in industry or a research project for those interested in pursuing academic or industry research.
